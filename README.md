# Ecommerce-Website
🛒 E-Commerce Website – Project Description

Developed a basic E-Commerce web application using Java Servlets, JSP, and JDBC, deployed on the Apache Tomcat server. The application follows the MVC architecture, where Servlets handle business logic, JSP pages manage the user interface, and JDBC is used for database connectivity.

The website allows users to browse products, register and log in, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders. Product and user data are stored and managed in a MySQL database, ensuring persistent storage and efficient data retrieval.

Servlets are responsible for handling HTTP requests, validating user inputs, and interacting with the database through JDBC. JSP pages dynamically display content such as product lists, cart details, and order summaries. Session management is implemented to maintain user login state and shopping cart data.

The application is packaged as a WAR file and deployed on Apache Tomcat, enabling smooth request handling and server-side processing.
